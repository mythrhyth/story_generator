# 📖 AI Story Generator

Welcome to the **AI Story Generator App**! This web application uses a trained LSTM model to generate creative story continuations based on a user-provided starting sentence.

## 🚀 Demo

Start the app locally:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧠 About the Project

This project uses deep learning with LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to build a **text generation model** trained on story-like text. The trained model continues a sentence by predicting and generating the next words, one at a time.
